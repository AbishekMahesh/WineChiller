# WineChiller
WineChiller Demo Code 

How To Run:

1. Plug Arduino into the computer, take note of the USB port number.
2. Update usb.py to your USB port for the arduino
3. Open a Terminal Box, run "python usb.py" Should be printing the current state of the ardunio pins into the terminal.
4. In a seperate Terminal Run python pyserver.py
5. In a browser open http://localhost:8000/tester.html this has the image side, with a JS function which pulls from f1.txt and displays accordingly. 


Things still do to:

1. Show certain wine images upon button selections of 1 of the 6 wines, for example. If Wine 3 is chosen and Pin 2 (010000) is pushed down show Wine 3 image in the second spot.


2. Set up on Raspberri Pi to Display.
